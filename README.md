Inventory Management System (IMS)

The Inventory Management System (IMS) is a full-stack web application designed to help businesses efficiently manage their inventory, products, billing, and customer transactions. The system provides an easy-to-use interface for tracking stock levels, searching products, generating receipts, and managing inventory operations.

This project follows a client-server architecture, where the frontend handles the user interface and user interactions, while the backend manages business logic, database operations, and API services.

The application helps improve inventory control by allowing users to maintain product records, monitor stock availability, and generate transaction receipts automatically.
